# Using docker-compose 

The idea of these project is to learn how to use docker-compose command, so I created a [MySQL image](/mysql-image/Dockerfile) and used the last [Python image](/projeto-04/Dockerfile).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The first thing you'll need is [Docket Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### How to use Docker Compose

You can follow this links to help you:

* [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Qw9zlE3t8Ko)

The MySQL image was not talked about in any of the last projects but you can check [this video](https://youtu.be/w_aVnMmrASE) to learn how to create one.

Don't forget to set the database port correctly on your .py file.

## Running the tests

After using the command Docker Compose command you will see that the containers have been created and they are up and running with no problem. You can test the web service via [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or even your browser if the method is set to GET.
